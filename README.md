Supervised Machine Learning

In the context of disease prediction from symptoms, supervised machine learning is a suitable approach. This is because we have historical data of symptom records and their corresponding diagnosed diseases, which can be used as a "correct answer" for training.

This repository contains an implementation of supervised machine learning models for predicting diseases based on symptoms. Here's a quick overview:

What you'll find:
1.Python code for data preprocessing and cleaning.
2.Implementations of popular machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machine for predicting diseases.
3.Tools for training, validating, and evaluating the performance of the machine learning models.

Requirements:
1.Python 3.7+
2.Scikit-learn
3.Pandas
4.NumPy

Getting Started:
1.Clone the repository.
2.Install the necessary libraries.
3.Preprocess and clean the data .
4.Choose a machine learning algorithm (e.g., SupportVectorMachine.py, DecisionTree.py, RandomForest.py).
5.Run the chosen algorithm file (TeamKK_ProjectCode.py) to train the model.
6.Observe the training progress and model performance in the terminal.
7.Use provided visualization scripts to analyze the model's behavior.

Structure:
1.data: Contains raw and preprocessed data files.
2.models: Holds the machine learning algorithms and model code.
3.helper: Data preprocessing, evaluation, and visualization scripts.
4.README.md: This file (you're reading it!)

Additional Notes:
1.Feel free to modify the code to experiment with different machine learning algorithms, parameters, and training configurations.
2.Share your findings and improvements via pull requests or issue reports.
